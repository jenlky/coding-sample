/* 
  I have an inbox full of emails.The addresses are stored in a list called “allEmails”.
  I also have a list of my friends’ email addresses called “friendList”.
  I want to know how many of the emails in allEmails are from friends.
  Write a function/method that takes in “friendList” and “allEmails” as parameters, 
    then returns the number of emails in allEmails that are from a friend. 
  Do not print the result, just return the result.  You can assume both lists are not null.  

  Example:
  friendList = “friend@catena-technologies.com”, “bff@uni.edu.sg”, “provost@uni.edu.sg”, “john@doe.com”
  allEmails = “enemy@uni.edu.sg”, “bff@uni.edu.sg”, “evil@spam.com”, “bff@uni.edu.sg”, “friend@catena-technologies.com”

  return: 3
